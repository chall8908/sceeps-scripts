Need to do:
==========

[] prospector role
* prospectors find nearby workable sources to mine

[] panic mode
* builds a cheap prospector with the "panic" flag
** the panic flag tells the prospector to ignore containers when returning energy

Potential optimizations:
=======================
* Better hauling logic
** Haulers pick containers to pick up from and only pick from that one until empty?
** Do reservations like with sources?
